1. install bs4 

2. If you are using an iOS device, go to spotlight and type "Install Certificates.command", then press Enter.

3. Open Number.py, in the command line, input either python3 number.py --number <Insert a four-digit letter (no need quotes)> OR python3 number.py --sentence <Insert a sentence you like>

4. The code should result in one/two new png files. One named "figure_digit.png" and another named "figure_sentence.png".

If you've input a 4-digit number, "figure_digit.png" gives a drawing that is generated by the 4-digit number. (No "figure_sentence.png" in this case)

If you've input a sentence, "figure_digit.png" gives a heart graph, and "figure_sentence.png" gives a frequency chart of the letters that appeared in the sentence.

5. Our code would also open a tab on your browser that tells you which tarot card you've drawn based on the 4-digit/sentence input. 

6. Our code should also open another tab on your browser that suggests you a k-pop song corresponding to your input 4-digit/sentence.
